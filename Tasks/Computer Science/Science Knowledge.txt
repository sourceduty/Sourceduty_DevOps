Science requires vast amounts of accessible, organized, and well-structured knowledge to advance research in all fields. One crucial type of data is comprehensive genomic information for a wide range of organisms across the tree of life. This includes complete genome sequences with annotations, transcriptome profiles under various conditions, proteome maps, metabolomic datasets, epigenomic landscapes, microbiome compositions, and more. Having this wealth of molecular-level biological data available in standardized formats would enable powerful comparative analyses to uncover evolutionary relationships, identify conserved regulatory elements, discover novel genes and pathways, understand the basis for phenotypic diversity, and develop new tools for genetic engineering and synthetic biology.

Beyond genomics, science also needs large-scale datasets on environmental parameters like climate variables (temperature, precipitation, CO2), soil properties, water quality, atmospheric composition, ocean currents, etc., as well as biodiversity surveys of plants, animals, fungi across different ecosystems over time. This would allow researchers to model and predict the impacts of human activities and natural disturbances on ecological systems at local to global scales. Other valuable data types include remote sensing images for monitoring land use change, demographic records for studying population dynamics, archaeological finds for reconstructing past societies, linguistic databases for tracing language evolution, etc. By making these diverse datasets openly accessible in a machine-readable format with clear metadata and documentation, science can accelerate discovery across disciplines through interdisciplinary collaborations enabled by data mining, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics techniques.
