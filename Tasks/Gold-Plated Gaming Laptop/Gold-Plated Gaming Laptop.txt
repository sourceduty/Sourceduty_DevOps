Base Cost of the Gaming Laptop:

- High-end gaming laptops typically range from $1,500 to $3,000 or more depending on the specifications (CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, etc.).

Gold Plating Cost:

- Gold plating typically costs around $50 to $150 per square inch. The exact cost can vary based on the thickness of the gold layer and the complexity of the plating process.
- Assuming a laptop surface area of approximately 200 square inches (this is a rough estimate, actual area can vary), the cost of gold plating could be significant. For example, at $100 per square inch, the cost would be:
  200 square inches * $100 per square inch = $20,000.

Customization and Labor Costs:

- Customizing a laptop with gold plating would require specialized labor, which can add to the cost. This can include disassembly, plating, and reassembly.
- Labor costs could range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars depending on the complexity and location.

Other Customization Options:

- Additional custom features like engraved designs, custom lighting, or unique software installations can also add to the cost.

Estimated Total Cost:

- Base Laptop Cost: $2,000 (mid-range high-end gaming laptop)
- Gold Plating: $20,000
- Customization and Labor: $1,000

Total Estimated Cost: $23,000
